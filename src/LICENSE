Program Name: RChoiceHB

Implements an MCMC algorithm to estimate a Hierarchical Multinomial Logit
model with a normal heterogeneity distribution. The algorithm uses a hybrid
Gibbs Sampler with a random walk metropolis step for the MNL coefficients for
each unit. Dependent variable can only be discrete. Independent variables can
only be discrete.

This program is based on ChoiceModelR package by Decision Analyst, Inc. which
itself is built upon the excellent work of Peter Rossi, Ph.D., 
Anderson School, UCLA.  In particular it builds on the rhierMnlRwMixture
program of the R Language package, bayesm, authored by Peter Rossi.
